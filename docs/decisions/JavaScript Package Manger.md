In previous years, [yarn] had more features and significantly outperformed [npm].
This is no longer the case.
Today, both packages managers are fast and support [workspaces].
But, [yarn] still has more features,
e.g. automatic lockfile conflict resolution.
However, the most compelling reason to use [yarn] is its continued innovation.
The [yarn] team continues to push package management in new directions with
[Plug'nPlay][pnp], [Zero-Installs][zero-installs], and more.
While the community many not be ready to adopt these features yet,
their potential to shape the future of package management cannot be understated.
